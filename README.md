# Jammming

[Jammming](https://song-life.surge.sh) is a responsive react web app that uses the Spotify API to:
- display the user's Spotify playlists
- search for music tracks
- create a playlist
- save the playlist to the user's Spotify account

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
